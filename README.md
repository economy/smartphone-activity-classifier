# Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set

This is a multivariate classification problem from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, found here: 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions

The dataset is comprised of sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope) data from Samsung smartphones, recorded while test subjects engaged in one of six activities:
- Standing
- Sitting
- Lying down
- Walking on a flat surface
- Walking upstairs
- Walking downstairs

My goal is to come up with a neural net classifier using Keras. Using only the sensor readings, the net should predict accurately which of the six activities the test subject was engaged in.
